# [FRC Team 6000 - Firehawk Robotics](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/6000)
Team 6000 is the first fully Orthodox Jewish team to compete in the First Robotics Competition. We were founded in 2016 and primarily compete in Los Angeles Regional, which we won as part of Alliance 1 in 2020. We work very closely with [Team 702 - Bagel Bytes](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/702) who graciously drive and repair our robot for us when religious observance prevents us from competing.
